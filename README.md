# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Nerissa Leynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

We are creating a backend server containing data that we will be using to pass into our front-end. The front-end will be requesting data from our server, and the back-end will send a response to that request. We will be bringing in libraries that will allow these two to communicate to each other.

Modularize the back-end codebase for easy reading and debugging.

## Getting Started

- Create new repo 'city-explorer-api', initialized with README file. Clone the repo to your local machine (on your project directory), and ACP.

- Run the command npm init to create new project and review the package.json file to make sure it is created

- Run the command npm install and make sure to add the following dependencies:
  - express
  - dotenv
  - cors

- Manually add the .gitignore and .eslintrc.json files

- Copy the contents of weather.json and paste it to your local machine/VS code - data/weather.json

## Architecture

Languages, Frameworks, and platforms:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Bootstrap
- GitHub
- Trello
- Netlify
- Node.js
- Heroku
- Express
- dotenv
- cors

## Change Log

10-26-2022 8:11 pm - Application now has a fully-functional front-end and back-end

10-27-22 12:29am - Application now is sending weather data response to front end

10-27-2022 8:11 pm - The backend are now able to send data to the front-end, getting information from third party API's 'Weatherbit' and 'Movie DB'

10-27-2022 11:15 pm - The back-end codebase has now been modularize for easy reading/debugging

10-29-2022 11:47 pm - the Weather component now has the WeatherData child component. The Movie component also now has a child component
